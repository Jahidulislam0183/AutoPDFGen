# AutoPDFGen
## Overview: 
 AutoPDFGen is an automated PDF report generation tool built using Python and Tableau’s REST API. It streamlines the process of exporting customized PDF reports from Tableau Server while dynamically adjusting multiple parameters. The project’s primary business objectives are as follows:

#### 1. Bulk PDF Generation:
* AutoPDFGen enables the efficient creation of a large number of PDF reports in a short time frame. Whether it’s daily, weekly, or monthly reports, the tool 	 ensures scalability and productivity.
	 
#### 2. Error-Free Automation:
* By automating the entire workflow, AutoPDFGen eliminates the risk of human errors. Repetitive tasks, such as exporting reports, are executed consistently without manual intervention.

#### 3. Time Savings:
* Manual PDF report generation can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with multiple parameters and datasets. AutoPDFGen significantly reduces the time spent on this process, allowing teams to focus on analysis and decision-making.

#### 4. Business Insights:
* The generated PDF reports provide valuable insights into various aspects of the business—financial performance, sales trends, marketing effectiveness, and operational metrics.

## Key Features:

#### 1. REST API Integration: 
  Leverages Tableau’s REST API to interact with the server and retrieve data.

#### 2. Parameterized Reports: 
  Allows users to specify parameters (such as date ranges, filters, and dimensions) for report customization.

#### 3. Automated Workflow: 
  Sets up a scheduled or event-triggered workflow to generate PDF reports without manual intervention.

#### 4. RPA Approach: 
  Adopts Robotic Process Automation (RPA) principles to enhance efficiency and reduce human effort.
